# Discriminator Atlas (Canonicalized)

Canonical note: entries are grouped by discriminator pattern directly from `lcg/lcg_graph.json`.

## ensemble_split
- Q000001 / D-IOB-001 (transferable=true): Observable = narrative closure versus regress when order/chaos accounts are recursively restated. Split = keep when recurrence yields stable closure without forcing an ultimate substrate; reject when explanation enters uncontrolled regress.
- Q000004 / D-IOB-002 (transferable=true): Observable = dependency chain of rule-survivors across inversion cycles. Split = keep when survivor rules remain derivable from prior distinctions; reject when inversion forces discontinuous rule resets.
- Q000008 / D-LCG-001 (transferable=true): Observable = ledger stability / taxonomy drift across loop iterations. Split = keep when seam classes remain stable through iterations; reject when category drift accumulates.
- Q000008 / D-LCG-002 (transferable=true): Observable = taxonomy drift under adversarial relabeling. Split = stable seam typing vs drift/explosion under perturbation. Transferability: true, because adversarial relabel stress tests can be reused anywhere a typed ledger must remain stable.

## interface_scatter
- Q000003 / D-PHY-001 (transferable=true): Observable = loop/closure residue after local gauge rewrites. Split = keep when closed-loop residue remains measurable; reject when signal is removable by local chart choice. Orthogonality note: this test targets closure-stable residue magnitude, not operator-class admissibility or unit-scaling behavior.
- Q000006 / D-PHY-003 (transferable=true): Observable = orientation residue after closed transport with polarity flips. Split = keep when orientation residue survives closure; reject when residue disappears under relabeling. Orthogonality note: this test isolates orientation/parity structure rather than generic gauge-equivalence filtering.
- Q000009 / D-PHY-004 (transferable=true): Observable = dimensionless drift under uniform rescaling. Split = keep when dimensionless ratios remain invariant; reject when measured drift depends on representational units. Orthogonality note: this test targets scaling sensitivity, not loop-residue closure or polarity effects.
- Q000010 / D-PHY-005 (transferable=true): Observable = observability equivalence class under gauge transformation. Split = keep only operators stable across gauge-equivalent descriptions; reject gauge-dependent quantities as observables. Orthogonality note: this test classifies admissible operator families, not whether a particular loop residue is non-zero.
- Q000019 / D-TIM-002 (transferable=true): Observable = cross-context persistence of arrow-like asymmetry under chart shifts. Split = arrow arises only from local coarse-graining vs requires a global orientation constraint. Transferability: true, because cross-context arrow-persistence checks can be reused wherever local asymmetry must be distinguished from globally imposed direction.
- Q000021 / D-BRID-021 (transferable=true): Observable = what changes when we translate 'procedure-valid' into 'ontology-admissible'. Split = handoff preserves seam visibility vs handoff reifies method outcomes as ontology.

## orthogonal_probe
- Q000002 / D-CI-001 (transferable=true): Observable = primitive budget / silent premise count after formal restatement. Split = pass only when formalization preserves entailments without increasing primitive count; fail when any new primitive or hidden axiom is required to recover the claim.
- Q000005 / D-PHY-002 (transferable=false): Observable = constraint consistency in geometry-first vs force-first framing. Split = keep when constraints close without external stage assumptions; reject when force framing requires extra background structure.
- Q000007 / D-CI-002 (transferable=true): Observable = typed seam count under ontic-entry vs epistemic-entry framing. Split = pass only when seam types remain visible and consistently typed across entry framings; fail when framing shifts mask seams or collapse distinct seam types into one label.
- Q000011 / D-011-001 (transferable=true): Observable = stability of inside/out/backwards role-assignment under negation and restatement. Split = keep when role assignment is preserved across charts; reject when negation swaps roles without criterion.
- Q000012 / D-012-001 (transferable=false): Observable = minimality of primitive commitments needed to keep constraint-order-memory jointly binding. Split = keep when the triad remains jointly required with fixed primitives; reject when one term becomes optional without loss.
- Q000013 / D-013-001 (transferable=true): Observable = dependency of each distinction on further distinctions in recursive self-differentiation. Split = keep when recursion sustains differentiation without terminal identity freeze; reject when recursion collapses into static binaries.
- Q000014 / D-014-001 (transferable=true): Observable = stability of ground claims under negative versus positive restatement. Split = keep when ground remains a relation of differentiation; reject when restatement reifies ground as a thing.
- Q000015 / D-015-001 (transferable=true): Observable = persistence of self-relation signatures across coordinate/model restatements. Split = keep when relation remains intrinsic across charts; reject when it only appears in one framing.
- Q000016 / D-016-001 (transferable=false): Observable = narrative closure behavior of continual-difference claims under repeated identity pressure. Split = keep when difference-production remains open-ended yet coherent; reject when closure requires reinstating fixed identity.
- Q000017 / D-017-001 (transferable=false): Observable = boundary stability of negative-ground language under attempted positive completion. Split = keep when negation remains constitutive of the ground claim; reject when positive completion becomes required.
- Q000018 / D-TIM-001 (transferable=false): Observable = minimality of primitive commitments in division-first versus composition-first descriptions. Split = keep when division remains primitive under reformulation; reject when division is derivable from composition plus bookkeeping.
- Q000019 / D-019-001 (transferable=false): Observable = local arrow persistence after global timeline re-indexing. Split = keep when local directionality survives without a global arrow; reject when a global direction is required.
- Q000020 / D-020-001 (transferable=true): Observable = bias emergence in constrained search without desire terms. Split = keep when directional behavior appears from structure alone; reject when intrinsic desire primitives are necessary.
