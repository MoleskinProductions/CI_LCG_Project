# Edge Justifications

- E000001 (E1_SharedLeak) Q000001 → Q000004: Both frame rule formation as survival under differentiation, indicating a shared L4-style seam between change and persistence. Evidence: P0148, P0284
- E000002 (E4_ChartBridge) Q000002 → Q000007: Formalization and entry-point leakage both hinge on chart selection and explicit seam marking, forming a method bridge. Evidence: P0228, P0338
- E000003 (E4_ChartBridge) Q000002 → Q000008: Formalization goals are operationalized by the agentic loop; both encode chart discipline as workflow. Evidence: P0228, P0350
- E000004 (E4_ChartBridge) Q000007 → Q000008: Entry-point leak handling is implemented by the loop as a chart-governed procedure, linking seams to workflow. Evidence: P0338, P0350
- E000005 (E4_ChartBridge) Q000003 → Q000010: Both depend on gauge-invariant loop/interface residues, bridging local gauge freedom with global observables. Evidence: P0280, P0263
- E000006 (E4_ChartBridge) Q000003 → Q000009: Loop-residue questions and uniform rescaling both test what survives re-description, linking gauge redundancy to detectability. Evidence: P0280, P0254
- E000007 (E4_ChartBridge) Q000006 → Q000003: Magnetic orientation intuition connects to loop-based residue tests as an interface between local orientation and global invariants. Evidence: P0294, P0280
- E000008 (E4_ChartBridge) Q000005 → Q000004: Gravity’s primacy question and rule-formation both concern how constraints become structural rather than merely local. Evidence: P0289, P0284
- E000009 (E1_SharedLeak) Q000009 → Q000010: Both focus on detectability under gauge/measurement re-description, indicating a shared constraint seam. Evidence: P0254, P0263
- E000010 (E3_DiscriminatorTransfer) Q000003 → Q000010: Loop residue tests (interface_scatter) apply directly to gauge-invariant observable checks; both use closed-loop comparison discriminators. Evidence: P0280, P0263
- E000011 (E3_DiscriminatorTransfer) Q000002 → Q000007: Orthogonal-probe discriminators for chart boundaries transfer between formalization checks and entry-point leak splits. Evidence: P0228, P0338
- E000012 (E3_DiscriminatorTransfer) Q000009 → Q000010: Orthogonal-probe tests for dimensionless drift transfer to gauge invariance checks as a shared detectability discriminator. Evidence: P0254, P0263
