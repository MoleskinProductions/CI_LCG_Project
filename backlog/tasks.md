## A0 Integrator Task Batch (2026-02-04)

- [C1-Task-01] Q000002/Q000007/Q000008: refine the shared primitive-budget and ledger-stability interfaces; done means E000002-E000004 cite one measurable counterexample each and all three node discriminators remain non-overlapping.
- [C1-Task-02] Q000008: add one robustness discriminator for taxonomy drift under adversarial relabeling; done means discriminator has explicit observable, split criterion, and transferability flag decision.

- [C2-Task-01] Q000011/Q000012/Q000014/Q000017: tighten orthogonal-probe distinctions so each uses a different observable axis; done means no pair in C2 reuses the same observable phrase or split logic.
- [C2-Task-02] Q000001/Q000004/Q000018: strengthen weak E1 adjacency evidence with one concrete invariant linkage per edge; done means E000001/E000020/E000021 each references at least one invariant id from both endpoints.

- [C3-Task-01] Q000003/Q000009/Q000010: verify interface_scatter transfer chain; done means E000010 and E000012 each include one explicit failure mode where transfer would break.
- [C3-Task-02] Q000006/Q000003: formalize orientation-residue bridge test; done means E000007 justification names a reproducible closure procedure and expected residue signature.

- [C4-Task-01] Q000015/Q000019: operationalize directionality persistence with one additional discriminator candidate; done means candidate includes measurement axis, split criterion, and compatibility check against C3 observability vocabulary.
- [C4-Task-02] Q000015/Q000014/Q000017/Q000019: validate cross-constellation bridge consistency; done means E000018 and E000019 share no duplicated wording but reference compatible interface variables.

- [C5-Task-01] Q000020: add one transferable discriminator linking constrained-search bias to another node outside C5; done means one new candidate edge proposal is documented with pattern, axis, and transfer rationale.
- [C5-Task-02] Q000020/Q000016: stress-test non-desire intentionality split; done means at least one counterexample case is encoded in discriminator how_to text.
