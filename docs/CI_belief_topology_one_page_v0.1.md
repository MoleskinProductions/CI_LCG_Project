# CI for Mapping Personal Belief Systems & “Theories of Mind”  
**A one-page, esoteric-but-actionable use case**  
Version: **v0.1** • Generated: **2026-01-30T00:00:00Z**

## Aim
Use **Complexical Induction (CI)** to build a **topology** (graph + clusters) of:
- personal belief systems / ontologies (“what exists / matters / counts as real”), and
- structural accounts of mind and identity (Enneagram, MBTI, Big Five, Freud/Jung, attachment theory, predictive processing, narrative self, etc.),

by identifying **where each framework leaks** (fails, overreaches, or becomes unfalsifiable) and which **discriminators** can actually split competing stories.

This is not “which model is true?” first. It’s: **what kind of thing is each model, what can it explain, and where does it break?**

---

## CI translation: what are the objects?

### Node = a framework-as-chart
A node is a belief system or mind model treated as a **Chart**: a representation that compresses experience into a set of claims and practices.

**Node fields (CI style):**
- **Claims:** what it asserts (explicitly)  
- **Scope:** what it’s trying to explain (identity, motivation, meaning, pathology, ethics, etc.)  
- **Interface variables:** how it touches reality (tests, self-reports, therapy outcomes, predictions, behaviors)  
- **Invariants:** what it holds fixed (e.g., “type is stable,” “unconscious drives exist,” “traits are continuous,” “narrative continuity matters”)  
- **Leak profile (L1–L6):** dominant failure modes  
- **Discriminators:** what could prove it wrong *or* separate it from rivals  

### Edge = structural relation (not “similar vibes”)
Edges connect frameworks by **structural adjacency**, e.g.:
- **E1 SharedLeak:** they fail in the same way (e.g., heavy L5 unfalsifiability)  
- **E2 ComplementaryLeak:** one’s seam is another’s glue (e.g., trait models vs narrative models)  
- **E3 DiscriminatorTransfer:** a test strategy in one can test the other (e.g., intervention studies)  
- **E4 ChartBridge:** they share interface variables (e.g., therapy outcomes, predictive accuracy, stability over time)

## Leak ladder (specialized to “theories of mind”)
Same L1–L6 ladder, but tuned to this domain:

- **L1 — Definition leak:** “self,” “type,” “ego,” “shadow,” “subconscious,” “archetype” not operationalized.  
- **L2 — Measurement leak:** relies on self-report, barnum effects, demand characteristics, cultural priors, or weak reliability.  
- **L3 — Mechanism leak:** descriptive typology masquerading as causal explanation (“you do X because you’re type Y”).  
- **L4 — Scaling leak:** individual ↔ group / development ↔ momentary state mapping is unclear; situation vs trait confounds.  
- **L5 — Boundary/ground leak:** value-laden metaphysics sneaks in (“true self,” cosmic purpose, moral realism) or observer-included claims become immune to test.  
- **L6 — Underdetermination leak:** multiple frameworks fit the same life story equally well; interpretive flexibility overwhelms evidence.

Practical note: CI doesn’t treat L5/L6 as “bad.” It treats them as **hazard zones** requiring explicit disclaimers and stronger discriminators.

## The CI procedure (for the “belief topology” project)

### Step 1 — Canonicalize each framework as a Chart
For each: write a **one-paragraph operational charter**:
- What does it predict *in principle*?
- What data channels does it accept (self-report, behavior, biology, clinical outcomes)?
- What would surprise it?

### Step 2 — Assign leak profile (and justify it)
Example rough instincts:
- **Enneagram / MBTI:** often **L2 + L3 + L6** heavy (measurement + mechanism + underdetermination).  
- **Big Five (trait psychometrics):** typically stronger on L2 than typologies, but still **L4** (trait–state–context scaling).  
- **Freud/Jung (clinical hermeneutics):** often **L1 + L5 + L6** (definition + metaphysical boundary + interpretive flexibility).  
- **Narrative identity accounts:** **L4 + L5** (scaling + normative/meaning boundary).  
- **Predictive processing / active inference (as broad frame):** can drift to **L5/L6** if everything becomes “prediction error,” unless tied to concrete discriminators.

### Step 3 — Extract invariants (the “non-negotiables”)
Examples:
- “Type is stable across contexts.”  
- “Interventions change measurable behavior in predictable ways.”  
- “Developmental history constrains adult dynamics.”  
- “Identity is an invariant under memory/continuity transformations.”

Invariants are **glue keys** for edges and clusters.

### Step 4 — Choose discriminators that actually split models
You want discriminators that reduce interpretive wiggle-room:

**D1 — Test–retest + measurement invariance (L2 killer):**  
Does the framework survive across time, cultures, and translations?

**D2 — Predictive validity (behavioral):**  
Can it predict something not already known from baseline traits/demographics?

**D3 — Intervention sensitivity (therapy / training):**  
If you change X, does the model predict *how* outcomes change? (Not just post-hoc explanation.)

**D4 — Counterfactual stress ramps:**  
What happens when you perturb identity anchors: sleep deprivation, role changes, social context flips, memory editing thought experiments?

**D5 — Competing-model tournaments (L6 killer):**  
Pre-register predictions, then compare frameworks head-to-head on the same dataset and outcomes.

### Step 5 — Build the topology (graph) and mine structure
You will see clusters like:
- **Psychometrics cluster** (measurement-heavy, improved L2)  
- **Hermeneutic/clinical cluster** (meaning-heavy, high L5/L6)  
- **Mechanistic neuro cluster** (stronger L3, but risks L4 scaling)  
- **Metaphysical ontology cluster** (explicit L5, possibly intentionally non-empirical)

CI’s point: make these clusters **explicit**, and prevent category mistakes (e.g., treating hermeneutics like a lab instrument, or treating a personality quiz like a causal theory).

## Outputs you should expect
- A **belief/mind atlas** where each node has a leak profile and discriminators.  
- A **“what this is good for”** map: introspection tool vs clinical heuristic vs measurable model.  
- A list of **keystone seams** (recurring leaks across many frameworks).  
- A **discriminator playbook** reusable across domains (your LCG idea, applied to “selves”).

## One hard truth (CI-friendly)
A lot of identity systems function as **compression algorithms for autobiography**—useful for meaning and coordination—while being weak as causal theories. CI lets you keep the usefulness **without confusing it for physics**.

---

## CI in one line (this context)
**Treat each belief system as a chart → name its leaks → demand discriminators → connect frameworks by structural seams → iterate.**
