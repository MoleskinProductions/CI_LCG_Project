# PATCH-20260204-221840

- Task: `TASK-BOOTSTRAP`
- Target: `node` `Q000021`

## Why This Addresses the Hotspot
No persisted task suggestions yet; bootstrap patch proposes additional discriminator coverage on the method-to-ontology bridge node.

## Operations
- `add` `/nodes/Q000021/discriminators/-`

## What Could Go Wrong (New Seams)
- Placeholder discriminator text may create false confidence if not refined before execution.
- Edge reclassification can overfit current runs; validate with at least two additional seeds.
- Interface-variable binding can be too generic if the selected variable is mismatched to observed seams.

## Acceptance Criteria
Node gains a second non-overlapping discriminator and rerun artifacts confirm seam visibility under handoff translation.

- Suggested agent: `C1_Method_Specialist`
