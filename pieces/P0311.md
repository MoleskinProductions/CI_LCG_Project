## CI Annotation
**Chart tags:** [workflow, computation, simulation, validation]
**Leak profile:** {L1: 0.2, L2: 0.2, L3: 0.2, L4: 0.3, L5: 0.5, L6: 0.6}
**Dominant leaks:** L6, L5
**Invariants:**
- I-P0311-001: Procedure order — The step sequence remains fixed across restatements.
- I-P0311-002: Output artifact — The procedure’s stated output type remains stable.
**Discriminators:**
- D-P0311-001: Stepwise execution check (pattern=stress_ramp) — Run the steps in order and verify the described outputs appear. (class=process)
**Discriminator class:** process
**Claims discipline:** methodological
**Dependencies check:** None noted
