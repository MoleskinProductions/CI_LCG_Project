# P0305 — Turing Instability as Bridge

**Intent:** bridge  
**Anchors:** ChatGPT response on research track  
**Depends on:** P0303

## Transcript excerpt
> "Turing patterns... formal way to say rules as survivor-invariants"

## Notes
Uses Turing instability to connect philosophy to physics.

## CI Annotation
**Chart tags:** [physics, measurement, constraint, computation]
**Leak profile:** {L1: 0.4, L2: 0.3, L3: 0.6, L4: 0.5, L5: 0.2, L6: 0.2}
**Dominant leaks:** L3, L4
**Invariants:**
- I-P0305-001: Mapping link — The bridge relation between domains remains intact.
- I-P0305-002: Cross-context consistency — The connection preserves the stated alignment.
**Discriminators:**
- D-P0305-001: Cross-domain alignment test (pattern=orthogonal_probe) — Apply the bridge to a mismatched case and see if alignment holds. (class=interface)
**Discriminator class:** interface
**Claims discipline:** interpretive-leaning
**Dependencies check:** None noted
