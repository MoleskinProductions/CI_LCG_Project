**Leak profile:** {L1: 0.2, L2: 0.2, L3: 0.2, L4: 0.3, L5: 0.7, L6: 0.5}
**Dominant leaks:** L5, L6
**Invariants:**
- I-P0332-001: Constraint statement — The rule’s boundary condition stays invariant.
- I-P0332-002: Allowed/forbidden split — The permitted vs. disallowed space is preserved.
**Discriminators:**
- D-P0332-001: Constraint violation probe (pattern=intervention) — Attempt a boundary-violating case to confirm the rule’s limit. (class=process)
**Discriminator class:** process
