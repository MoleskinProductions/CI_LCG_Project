# Argument Draft v0.1 (Graph-Faithful)

## Preface: What This Draft Is Doing

This manuscript is an argument-synthesis pass over the current LCG, not a theory rewrite. The organizing rule is simple: every substantive move must be anchored in node-level constraints (invariants + discriminators) and edge-level transition logic. Edges of type E3 are treated as discriminator transfers; edges of type E4 are treated as chart translations; E1 links are weak and are flagged explicitly as soft adjacency when used. 

The payoff of this discipline is not rhetorical certainty. The payoff is tractable uncertainty: we can separate what is constrained, what is bridged, and what is merely suggestive.

Grounding: [Q000002, Q000007, Q000008, Q000011, Q000012, Q000013, Q000014, Q000016, Q000017, Q000018, Q000003, Q000006, Q000009, Q000010, Q000015, Q000019, Q000020].

## Part I — CI / Method: Why the Reader Should Trust the Procedure

### 1. Formalization as primitive-budget accounting

The first methodological claim is narrow: a formal rewrite is admissible only if it preserves entailments while holding the primitive budget fixed. This is not merely a stylistic preference; it is the regime marker attached to the formalization node. In practical terms, the method asks whether restatement introduces hidden commitments that were not previously acknowledged. [Q000002, I-002-001, D-CI-001]

The entry-point node tightens this by demanding seam visibility under framing shifts. If an ontic framing and an epistemic framing produce different seam profiles, the procedure requires explicit typing of that difference rather than silent smoothing. [Q000007, I-007-001, D-CI-002]

The transfer claim between these two nodes is legitimate because the shared axis is explicit: premise visibility under chart rewrite. That is why E000011 is a true steel-beam transition rather than merely thematic overlap. [E000011]

> **Seam Note (E4):** `E000002` is a chart translation (`primitive budget / silent premise`), not an independent discriminator transfer. It carries method vocabulary across charts; it does not add a new truth-condition. [E000002]

### 2. Why looping helps only if taxonomy holds

Procedure becomes trustworthy only when iterative bookkeeping is stable. The loop node formalizes this as ledger consistency and now includes an adversarial relabel stress test: stability is measured under perturbation, not friendly conditions. [Q000008, I-008-001, D-LCG-001, D-LCG-002]

Two bridges matter here. First, formal commitments can be pushed into procedural loops if category labels stay stable (`E000003`). Second, entry-point seam typing remains meaningful across repeated passes only when taxonomy drift is controlled (`E000004`). [E000003, E000004]

> **Seam Note (E4):** both `E000003` and `E000004` are chart translations via `ledger stability / taxonomy drift`; they should not be read as proofs that loop outcomes are ontologically privileged.

At the end of Part I, the method grants permission to proceed, but not permission to over-claim. In graph terms: C1 validates process discipline, not the ontology itself.

## Part II — Ontology / Inversion / Ground: Minimal Claims Under Regime Markers

### 3. Mapping constraints before metaphysics

The C2 entry is deliberately conservative. The inside/out/backwards mapping is admissible only if role-assignment remains stable under negation and restatement. The paired constraint-order-memory node accepts triad language only when primitive commitments remain minimal and inseparability persists. [Q000011, Q000012, I-011-001, I-012-001, D-011-001, D-012-001]

The edge between them is strong because both nodes evaluate the same type of failure: chart rewrites that preserve vocabulary while changing assignment structure. [E000013]

Failure mode, explicitly: if a restatement keeps the same three labels but silently swaps structural roles, the transfer fails.

### 4. Differentiation, existence, and division

The second C2 strand builds from recursive self-differentiation to existence-as-continual-difference. The discriminator axis is not physical detectability; it is whether distinctions remain generative without collapsing into static binary closure. [Q000013, Q000016, D-013-001, D-016-001]

`E000014` is justified because both sides test non-terminal recursive dependency. If recursion bottoms out in fixed identity while continuing to claim ongoing differentiation, the bridge is invalid. [E000014]

Division as primitive enters this strand through a weak relation, not a hard one. The graph currently provides a soft adjacency from division to differentiation themes. [Q000018, D-TIM-001, E000020]

> **Seam Note (E1 soft adjacency):** `E000020` is weak similarity only. It can motivate comparative reading, but it cannot carry inferential load equivalent to E3/E4.

### 5. Ground under negation pressure

The third C2 strand concerns ground claims. The structured-differentiation node constrains ground to remain relational under re-description; the negative-ground node tests whether the claim survives attempts at positive completion. [Q000014, Q000017, I-014-001, I-017-001, D-014-001, D-017-001]

`E000015` is the key transfer: both nodes share an axis of negation-versus-posit stability. The edge fails the moment a positive substrate is inserted as a stabilizer, because that move breaks the regime marker itself. [E000015]

Taken together, Part II yields minimal ontology commitments: structured relation, recursive differentiation, and negative-boundary discipline. It does not yield a completed metaphysics.

## Part III — Physics as Chart Discipline (Worked Example)

Part III is not a derivation of ontology from physics. It is a stress test: can the same CI discipline separate admissible from inadmissible observables in a domain where chart dependence is obvious?

### 6. Closure residue and admissible observables

The Wilson-loop node introduces closure residue under local gauge rewrite; the gauge-theory requirements node classifies admissible observables by gauge-stable operator classes. [Q000003, Q000010, I-003-001, I-010-001, I-010-002, D-PHY-001, D-PHY-005]

`E000010` is now precise: non-zero closure residue can support inference only when evaluated with gauge-invariant operators rather than gauge-dependent potentials. This is the exact condition that defines admissible observable class in the target node. [E000010]

> **Seam Note (E4):** `E000005` is chart translation through `observability equivalence class`; it aligns representation spaces but does not independently prove transfer. [E000005]

### 7. Scaling and orientation checks

Two additional probes keep detectability honest. Uniform-rescaling tests reject observables that move under unit changes; orientation-residue tests isolate parity/orientation structure rather than generic gauge filtering. [Q000009, Q000006, D-PHY-004, D-PHY-003]

`E000012` carries a clear failure template: if an observable changes under unit scaling, it is not admissible. `E000007` and `E000006` supply chart bridges that connect orientation and scaling behavior to closure-level detectability questions. [E000012, E000007, E000006]

The methodological lesson of Part III is transferable even where details are not: robust claims require explicit invariants under chart change.

## Part IV — Time/Identity as a Stress Test

### 8. Why time claims are framed as translation first

The current graph intentionally classifies one crucial time edge as E4, not E3: relational persistence in Q000015 is translated into local-arrow persistence in Q000019 via the interface variable `local arrow persistence`. [Q000015, Q000019, E000016]

This choice matters. It blocks an overreach that would treat relational persistence and arrow persistence as identical discriminators. They are not. One is a relation-stability probe; the other is a local asymmetry persistence probe.

> **Seam Note (E4):** `E000016` is a chart translation, not a discriminator transfer; read it as a mapping discipline, not a theorem.

### 9. C2/C4 coupling without collapse

Two cross-constellation bridges anchor the coupling. `E000018` uses `constraint-order coupling` to connect relational persistence framing to structured ground; `E000019` uses `local arrow persistence` to connect time-arrow claims to negative-ground boundary discipline. [E000018, E000019, Q000014, Q000017]

In parallel, `E000022` contributes a transfer route from division irreducibility to local asymmetry persistence. The rationale is that asymmetry can persist without invoking global orientation if primitive division cannot be reduced away. [Q000018, Q000019, D-TIM-001, D-TIM-002, E000022]

This creates a controlled triangle (division, local arrow, negative ground) without forcing full identity across them.

## Part V — Intentionality as Bridge to Cognition

### 10. Bias without desire as a transfer hypothesis

The intentionality node claims that directional behavior can emerge from constrained search without adding desire primitives. The receiving ontology node claims existence as ongoing differentiation. The current graph links these through an E3 transfer (`E000017`). [Q000020, Q000016, D-020-001, D-016-001, E000017]

The admissible conclusion is modest: there is a reusable discriminator schema between constrained-search directionality and differentiation-based persistence. The inadmissible conclusion would be a complete theory of mind or agency from this single edge.

### 11. What has been shown, and what has not

Shown:
- Method constraints can be made auditable via primitive-budget and ledger-stability tests. [Q000002, Q000007, Q000008]
- Ontology claims can be narrowed by regime markers to prevent substance inflation. [Q000011–Q000018]
- Physics/time blocks function as disciplined chart-worked examples for detectability and persistence. [Q000003, Q000006, Q000009, Q000010, Q000015, Q000019]
- Cognition entry is a transfer bridge, not closure. [Q000020]

Not shown:
- A single global foundation that eliminates all seams.
- A proof that every cross-constellation bridge is bidirectional.
- A collapse of E4 translations into E3 transfers.

The draft therefore ends where it should: with a connected but explicitly seam-aware argument scaffold, suitable for specialist elaboration rather than premature unification.
