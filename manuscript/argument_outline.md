# Argument Outline (Graph-Faithful, v0.2)

Primary synthesis rule: claims are constrained by node invariants/discriminators; transitions use E3/E4 spine edges, with E1 flagged explicitly as soft adjacency.

## Part I — CI / Method (why the procedure is trustworthy)

### 1.1 Formalization and Entry Framing Discipline
- Claims constrained here:
  - Reformulation is valid only when primitive commitments stay explicit.
  - Entry framing is valid only when seams remain typed and visible.
  - Method trust is earned by explicit premise accounting.
- Regime markers used: `I-002-001`, `I-007-001`
- Discriminators used: `D-CI-001`, `D-CI-002`
- Transitions:
  - `E000011` (`Q000002 -> Q000007`)
  - `E000002` (E4, interface variable `primitive budget / silent premise`)

### 1.2 Loop Robustness and Handoff Preparation
- Claims constrained here:
  - Iteration is admissible only when taxonomy drift is controlled.
  - Adversarial relabeling is required for procedural robustness.
  - Procedural validity must be prepared for explicit handoff criteria.
- Regime markers used: `I-008-001`
- Discriminators used: `D-LCG-001`, `D-LCG-002`
- Transitions:
  - `E000003` (E4, interface variable `ledger stability / taxonomy drift`)
  - `E000004` (E4, interface variable `ledger stability / taxonomy drift`)
  - `E000023` (E4, interface variable `ledger stability / taxonomy drift`): `Q000008 -> Q000021`

### 1.3 Explicit Method→Ontology Bridge
- Claims constrained here:
  - Procedural license cannot be silently upgraded into ontic commitment.
  - Handoff succeeds only with explicit interface-variable accounting.
  - Ontological entry must preserve seam visibility across translation.
- Regime markers used: `I-BRID-021`, `I-011-001`
- Discriminators used: `D-BRID-021`, `D-011-001`
- Transitions:
  - `E000024` (E4, interface variable `primitive budget / silent premise`): `Q000021 -> Q000011`

## Part II — Ontology / inversion / ground (minimal claims + regime markers)

### 2.1 Triad Mapping and Constraint Coherence
- Claims constrained here:
  - Inside/out/backwards role assignment must remain stable under restatement.
  - Constraint-order-memory is admissible only if inseparability remains invariant.
- Regime markers used: `I-011-001`, `I-012-001`
- Discriminators used: `D-011-001`, `D-012-001`
- Transitions: `E000013`

### 2.2 Differentiation Spine and Primitive Division
- Claims constrained here:
  - Differentiation must remain recursively generative.
  - Existence-as-difference fails if static identity closure is required.
  - Division can be primitive only if composition-first reductions fail.
- Regime markers used: `I-013-001`, `I-016-001`, `I-018-001`
- Discriminators used: `D-013-001`, `D-016-001`, `D-TIM-001`
- Transitions: `E000014`, `E000020` (E1 soft adjacency)

### 2.3 Ground Under Negation Pressure
- Claims constrained here:
  - Ground remains relational, not substantive.
  - Negative-ground claims must survive positive completion pressure.
- Regime markers used: `I-014-001`, `I-017-001`
- Discriminators used: `D-014-001`, `D-017-001`
- Transitions: `E000015`

## Part III — Physics as chart discipline (gauge/detectability worked example)

### 3.1 Closure Residue and Admissible Observables
- Claims constrained here:
  - Closure residue is meaningful only via gauge-invariant operator classes.
  - Gauge-dependent potentials are excluded from admissible observables.
- Regime markers used: `I-003-001`, `I-010-001`, `I-010-002`
- Discriminators used: `D-PHY-001`, `D-PHY-005`
- Transitions: `E000010`, `E000005` (E4, `observability equivalence class`)

### 3.2 Scaling and Orientation Checks
- Claims constrained here:
  - Unit-scaling sensitivity disqualifies observables.
  - Orientation residue is distinct from generic equivalence-class checks.
- Regime markers used: `I-006-001`, `I-009-001`, `I-009-002`
- Discriminators used: `D-PHY-003`, `D-PHY-004`, `D-PHY-005`
- Transitions: `E000007`, `E000006`, `E000012`

## Part IV — Time/identity as stress test (local arrow persistence)

### 4.1 Relational Persistence to Local Arrow Persistence
- Claims constrained here:
  - Arrow persistence is a local residue, not a global orientation axiom.
  - Relational persistence translates to arrow-claims through explicit interface variables.
- Regime markers used: `I-015-001`, `I-019-001`
- Discriminators used: `D-015-001`, `D-019-001`, `D-TIM-002`
- Transitions: `E000016` (E4, `local arrow persistence`)

### 4.2 C2/C4 Coupling Without Collapse
- Claims constrained here:
  - Cross-constellation linkage stays translation-aware.
  - Division irreducibility supplies a transfer test for local asymmetry persistence.
- Regime markers used: `I-014-001`, `I-017-001`, `I-018-001`, `I-019-001`
- Discriminators used: `D-TIM-001`, `D-TIM-002`, `D-017-001`
- Transitions: `E000018` (E4 `constraint-order coupling`), `E000019` (E4 `local arrow persistence`), `E000022` (E3)

## Part V — Intentionality bridge to cognition

### 5.1 Bias Without Desire as Transfer Hypothesis
- Claims constrained here:
  - Directional behavior can emerge from constrained search without desire primitives.
  - This is a transfer hypothesis, not a complete reduction of cognition.
- Regime markers used: `I-020-001`, `I-016-001`
- Discriminators used: `D-020-001`, `D-016-001`
- Transitions: `E000017`
