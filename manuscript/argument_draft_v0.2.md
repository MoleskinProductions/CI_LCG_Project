# Argument Draft v0.2 (Method→Ontology Bridge Added)

## Preface

This version removes the prior editorial hinge between method and ontology by adding one explicit bridge node: `Q000021` (Procedural admissibility -> Ontological admissibility bridge). The argument now proceeds through recorded graph structure only: E3 for discriminator transfer, E4 for chart translation, E1 only as soft adjacency.

The result is stronger in discipline, not stronger in metaphysical claim. The bridge formalizes *how* one may move from procedure-valid to ontology-admissible statements without silently upgrading method output into ontology.

---

## Part I — CI/Method: Why the Procedure Merits Trust

The method block starts with explicit premise accounting. `Q000002` constrains formalization: reformulation is valid only when primitive commitments are not silently inflated. `Q000007` constrains entry framing: seam visibility must remain explicit under ontic/epistemic reframing. Together they ground a method ethic of accountable translation rather than persuasive restatement. [`Q000002`, `Q000007`, `D-CI-001`, `D-CI-002`, `I-002-001`, `I-007-001`, `E000011`, `E000002`]

Next, `Q000008` operationalizes this discipline as a loop with ledger checks and adversarial relabeling stress. Method confidence rises only when taxonomy drift is controlled under perturbation, not merely in clean iterations. [`Q000008`, `D-LCG-001`, `D-LCG-002`, `I-008-001`, `E000003`, `E000004`]

### Seam Note
This stage still yields procedural license only. Procedural success does not automatically create ontic entitlement.

---

## Part II — Explicit Method→Ontology Handoff (New Spine Segment)

`Q000021` is the new control point. Its regime marker states the handoff rule directly: if a move is licensed only procedurally, it cannot become ontic without an explicit interface variable. Its discriminator (`D-BRID-021`) asks exactly what changes when we translate “procedure-valid” into “ontology-admissible.” The split is binary and strict: either seam visibility is preserved, or method outcomes are reified as ontology.

Transition into this node is a chart translation from `Q000008` via `E000023`, using interface variable `ledger stability / taxonomy drift`. This means the method block supplies a *tracked* translation condition for admissibility, not a proof leap. [`Q000008`, `Q000021`, `E000023`]

Transition onward into ontology entry occurs through `E000024`, also an E4 bridge, using interface variable `primitive budget / silent premise`. This enforces premise-accounting continuity at the handoff boundary: no ontic commitment may be added “for free.” [`Q000021`, `Q000011`, `E000024`]

### Seam Note (E4)
`E000023` and `E000024` are chart translations, not discriminator transfers. They enforce boundary discipline; they do not settle ontology content by themselves.

---

## Part III — Ontology / Inversion / Ground Under Regime Markers

With handoff discipline in place, the ontology block remains minimal and conditional.

First, mapping constraints: `Q000011` and `Q000012` accept triad language only if role assignment and triad inseparability survive re-description with minimal commitments. This is codified by the E3 spine edge `E000013`, which includes an explicit failure form (role-swaps under restatement). [`Q000011`, `Q000012`, `D-011-001`, `D-012-001`, `I-011-001`, `I-012-001`, `E000013`]

Second, differentiation spine: `Q000013` and `Q000016` require recursive distinction-generation to remain non-terminal; static identity closure invalidates the claim. `E000014` carries this as a transfer rule. [`Q000013`, `Q000016`, `D-013-001`, `D-016-001`, `I-013-001`, `I-016-001`, `E000014`]

Third, ground under pressure: `Q000014` and `Q000017` constrain ground to relational/negative stability under posit-vs-negation restatement. `E000015` is valid only while positive substance insertion is resisted. [`Q000014`, `Q000017`, `D-014-001`, `D-017-001`, `I-014-001`, `I-017-001`, `E000015`]

`Q000018` contributes division irreducibility. Where linked by E1 (`E000021`) it remains soft; where linked by E3 (`E000022`) into local-arrow testing it carries transfer weight.

### Seam Note (E1 soft)
`E000021` is used only as a soft adjacency cue and is never treated as inferentially equivalent to E3/E4.

## Part IV — Physics as Chart Discipline (Worked Example)

Physics enters as a disciplined example of chart-sensitive admissibility, not as ontological override.

`Q000003` + `Q000010` define the core: closure residue has evidential force only through gauge-invariant operator classes; gauge-dependent potentials are excluded from admissible observables. This is precisely what `E000010` now states. [`Q000003`, `Q000010`, `D-PHY-001`, `D-PHY-005`, `I-003-001`, `I-010-001`, `I-010-002`, `E000010`]

Supporting E4 bridges keep translation boundaries explicit: `E000005` (`observability equivalence class`), `E000006` (`dimensionless drift`), and `E000007` (`orientation residue`). `E000012` adds a direct failure rule for scaling: if an observable changes under unit scaling, it is not admissible. [`Q000006`, `Q000009`, `E000005`, `E000006`, `E000007`, `E000012`]

### Seam Note (E4)
These are chart translations that align representations and observability classes; they are not ontological conclusions.

## Part V — Time/Identity Stress Test and Cognition Bridge

Time/identity remains carefully typed. `E000016` is intentionally E4: relational persistence (`Q000015`) translates into local-arrow persistence (`Q000019`) through interface variable `local arrow persistence`. This avoids a false identity claim between relation-constraints and arrow asymmetry. [`Q000015`, `Q000019`, `D-015-001`, `D-019-001`, `D-TIM-002`, `E000016`]

Cross-coupling with ontology is also translation-aware: `E000018` links into structured ground via `constraint-order coupling`; `E000019` links into negative-ground boundary via `local arrow persistence`; `E000022` adds a transfer from division irreducibility to local-asymmetry persistence. [`Q000014`, `Q000017`, `Q000018`, `Q000019`, `E000018`, `E000019`, `E000022`]

Finally, cognition linkage remains modest. `Q000020 -> Q000016` (`E000017`) supports a transfer hypothesis: directional bias can emerge from constrained search without desire primitives and still connect to differentiation-based persistence claims. It does not yield a complete theory of mind. [`Q000020`, `Q000016`, `D-020-001`, `D-016-001`, `I-020-001`, `E000017`]

## Conclusion: What v0.2 Fixes

v0.2 closes the main structural gap: method-to-ontology handoff is no longer an editorial gesture but an explicit chart bridge through `Q000021`, `E000023`, and `E000024`. The manuscript now preserves a single discipline across the full route:

- procedural validity is audited,
- handoff admissibility is explicitly translated,
- ontology claims remain regime-bound,
- physics/time examples sharpen chart discipline,
- cognition remains a bounded bridge.

This is a stronger argument scaffold because it is more constrained, not because it claims more.
